## Motivation

This post came about from a lecture I had during my Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree.  
The purpose of the lecture was to show how to build a neural network framework from
scratch that mimicked TensorFlow.  

change## Neural Networks



$$ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 $$

Inline math $$ e^2 $$ for inline equations!!

$$ e^2 $$

Testing some math input

but with text around it $$ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 $$



## Framework

{% highlight scala %}
trait Node
{% endhighlight %}

bundle exec jekyll serve ~
